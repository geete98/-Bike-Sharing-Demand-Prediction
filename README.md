Bike Sharing Demand Prediction
Project Overview
The ongoing COVID-19 outbreak has resulted in major revenue declines for US bike-sharing company BoomBikes. In order to increase income after the lockout, the corporation wants to create a strategic business strategy. In order to identify the factors impacting the demand for shared bikes in the American market, this project entails constructing a prediction model. The management will be able to optimize their operations and marketing initiatives by using the insights from this model to assist them make data-driven choices.

Problem Statement
Through the use of a bike-sharing program, anyone may pay for short-term bike rentals. Within the same system, users are able to check out bikes from one station and return them to another. BoomBikes has seen a significant drop in income as a result of the COVID-19 epidemic. In order to bounce back, the firm aims to identify the critical elements influencing the demand for shared bicycles.

Objectives
Identify Significant Variables: Determine which variables significantly impact the demand for shared bikes.
Predict Bike Demand: Develop a model that accurately predicts the demand for shared bikes based on historical data.
Data Description
The dataset includes a number of characteristics, such as user-specific information, time-related factors, and weather conditions, that might affect the demand for bikes. The dataset and its characteristics are briefly described below:

Features
Instant: Record index
dteday: Date
season: Season (1 = spring, 2 = summer, 3 = fall, 4 = winter)
yr: Year (0 = 2018, 1 = 2019)
mnth: Month (1 to 12)
holiday: Whether the day is a holiday (1 = yes, 0 = no)
weekday: Day of the week (0 to 6)
workingday: Whether the day is a working day (1 = yes, 0 = no)
weathersit: Weather situation (1 = clear, 2 = mist, 3 = light snow/rain, 4 = heavy snow/rain)
temp: Normalized temperature in Celsius
atemp: Normalized feeling temperature in Celsius
hum: Normalized humidity
windspeed: Normalized wind speed
casual: Count of casual users
registered: Count of registered users
cnt: Count of total bike rentals (target variable)
Methodology
The project follows a structured approach to ensure a comprehensive analysis and accurate model building. Here are the key steps:

Data Preprocessing
Missing Value Treatment: Handle any missing values in the dataset.
Feature Encoding: Convert categorical variables into numerical format using one-hot encoding.
Feature Scaling: Normalize or standardize numerical features to bring them to a comparable scale.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Univariate Analysis: Examine the distribution of individual features.
Bivariate Analysis: Analyze the relationship between each feature and the target variable.
Multivariate Analysis: Investigate the interactions between multiple features.
Model Building
Linear Regression: Develop a linear regression model to predict bike demand.
Model Evaluation: Assess the model's performance using metrics such as R-squared, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
Assumptions Validation
Linearity: Check if the relationship between independent and dependent variables is linear.
Independence: Ensure the residuals are independent.
Homoscedasticity: Verify that the residuals have constant variance.
Normality: Confirm that the residuals are normally distributed.
Results
The final model identifies the key factors influencing bike demand and provides a reliable prediction of bike rentals. The top contributing features are:

Temperature (temp)
Weather Situation (weathersit)
Season (season)
Model Performance
The model's performance on the test dataset is evaluated using the R-squared metric:

from sklearn.metrics import r2_score
r2_score(y_test, y_pred)
Conclusion
With the aid of this project, BoomBikes will be able to streamline its operations by developing a predictive model and effectively identifying the key elements influencing the demand for shared bikes. The management may make wise decisions to increase income and enhance customer happiness with the help of the insights obtained from this investigation.
